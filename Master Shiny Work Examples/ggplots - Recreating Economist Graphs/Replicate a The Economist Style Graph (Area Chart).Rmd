## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}


# Load some R packages: 

library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)
library(WDI)

# Collect data from World Bank: 

data <- WDI(country = "VN", 
            indicator = c("NE.IMP.GNFS.CD", "TM.VAL.MRCH.CD.WT", "TM.VAL.MRCH.WL.CD"), 
            start = 2005, end = 2015)


# Rename for columns and convert to long form: 

data %<>% rename(IMP = NE.IMP.GNFS.CD, 
                 MRW = TM.VAL.MRCH.CD.WT, 
                 MAC = TM.VAL.MRCH.WL.CD)



# Make plot: 

 my_font <- "sans"

#Data wrangling 
data %>%  
  select(year, IMP, MRW, MAC) %>% 
  gather(Item, b, -year) %>% 
  mutate(b = round(b / 1000000000)) %>% 
  
## Plotting
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = b, fill = Item)) + 
  geom_area(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_economist(name = "Product Code") + 
  
## Formatting
  theme_economist() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, 
       title = "Vietnam's Imports of Goods and Services: 2005 - 2015", 
       subtitle = "Unit in billion dollar and numbers adjusted for inflation rate and price of 2015.", 
       caption = "Data Source: The World Bank") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2005, 2015, 1), limits = c(2005, 2015.2), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 550), expand = c(0, 10), breaks = seq(0, 550, 100)) + 
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1.2, 1, 1), "cm")) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = my_font, size = 15, color = "gray20")) + 
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(family = my_font, size = 12, color = "gray40")) + 
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(family = my_font, size = 12, color = "gray40")) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(family = my_font, size = 10, color = "gray30")) + 
  theme(legend.text = element_text(family = my_font, size = 12, color = "grey30")) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_text(family = my_font, size = 16, color = "grey30")) 


grid.rect(x = 0.01, y = 0.93, hjust = 1, vjust = 0, gp = gpar(fill = "#e5001c", lwd = 1)) 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
